# cppgen
A ruby utility for generating C++ source files.

## Description
This provides a small CLI interface to generate C++ source files that I use
within my other projects. Although it is fairly specific to my own use-cases,
others may find it beneficial.

## Prerequisites
- ruby (Devloped and tested with version `2.4.2`, likely requires version `>= 2.0`)

## Usage
Run the cppgen script. See `cppgen --help` for usage.
